## ABSTRACT

Android malware detection and classification are essential tasks in maintaining the security of mobile devices and users' data. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately classify Android malware into distinct types and differentiate between malignant and benign samples. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks, we perform an exploratory data analysis, binary classification between malignant and benign malware, and feature engineering on a sample dataset to understand and confirm the effectiveness of various techniques. The final notebook consolidates the insights and techniques derived from previous notebooks to create a high-performing classifier for Android malware. 

Using a diverse set of classifiers, including Decision Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, and CatBoost, we ensure a comprehensive and robust model for malware detection. We also employ preprocessing techniques such as Standard Scaler for data normalization and SMOTE for addressing class imbalance, enhancing the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

The resulting machine learning model demonstrates the potential for accurate and efficient Android malware classification, providing a valuable tool for securing mobile devices and protecting users from malicious applications. The project's structured and systematic approach enables continuous improvement and adaptability, ensuring the model remains relevant and effective in the ever-evolving landscape of Android malware threats.

## 1.1. INTRODUCTION

The proliferation of mobile devices and applications has led to a surge in Android malware, posing significant security risks to users' personal data and device functionality. To address this challenge, the development of effective and efficient malware detection and classification models is crucial. In this project, we aim to create a machine learning model that accurately classifies Android malware into distinct types and differentiates between malignant and benign samples.

Our approach to the project is systematic and structured, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data and a robust model development process. We begin by analyzing the entire dataset, gaining insights into the features and relationships between different malware types and benign samples. This initial analysis allows us to explore the data's structure, characteristics, and statistical properties.

Next, we create a sample dataset to work on a more focused and manageable context. We perform binary classification between malignant and benign malware, serving as a foundational step in the overall malware classification process. Using the sample dataset, we also experiment with various feature engineering techniques, enabling us to understand and confirm their effectiveness before applying them to the entire dataset.

With the insights derived from the sample dataset, we proceed to develop and evaluate machine learning models for classifying Android malware into distinct types. We employ a diverse set of classifiers, including Decision Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, and CatBoost, ensuring a comprehensive and robust model for malware detection. Preprocessing techniques such as Standard Scaler and SMOTE are also applied to enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

This project report documents the methodology, techniques, and findings of our work, highlighting the potential of machine learning in addressing the critical task of Android malware detection and classification. Through a structured and systematic approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in securing mobile devices and protecting users from malicious applications, contributing to a safer mobile ecosystem.
